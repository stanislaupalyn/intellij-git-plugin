# Rename Current Commit Plugin

![Build](https://github.com/stanislaupalyn/intellij-git-plugin/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin allows you to rename the last Git commit with a new message. It adds this action to the Git section in the main toolbar.
<!-- Plugin description end -->

## Implementation

Action is added to Git main menu and toolbar both in new and classic UI.

![Git.Experimental.Branch.Popup.Actions](resources/screenshot_2.png)

![Git Main Menu](resources/screenshot_3.png)

![Old UI](resources/screenshot_1.png)

![Default Dialog](resources/screenshot_4.png)

![Dialog with Warnings](resources/screenshot_5.png)


Before allowing the commit message to be changed, the plugin checks:

- Whether there are staged changes, warning the user that they will be included in the amended commit.
- Whether the commit has already been pushed, warning the user that amending it will create a new commit diverging from the remote branch.


Git commands are executed using GitLineHandler, interacting directly with Git rather than relying on IntelliJâ€™s higher-level Git API.

Git command results are checked for errors before further execution. Errors are displayed using Messages.showErrorDialog()

All Git operations are executed in a background coroutine scope using IO Dispatcher. UI-related actions, such as displaying dialogs, are explicitly switched to the EDT.
